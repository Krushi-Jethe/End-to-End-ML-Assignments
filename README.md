# ML Project Lifecycle Assignments

This repository provides a **hands-on assignment series** designed to help learners gain practical experience across the entire **Machine Learning lifecycle**, including:

- Linux CLI, shell scripts, environment setup
- Data Cleaning & EDA
- SQL
- Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning
- Testing & Packaging
- Deployment (Docker + FastAPI + Streamlit)

Cloud deployment is currently out of scope. Future versions of this series will aim to incorporate AWS-based assignments using the free trial tier, ensuring accessibility without incurring additional costs.


## Whatâ€™s Inside?

Each stage of the ML lifecycle is broken into practical assignments. Scripts and notebooks help you get comfortable with both **concepts** and **production-level implementation**.
