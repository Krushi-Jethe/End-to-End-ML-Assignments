This is a group assignment. The work should be divided among the group. Create branches for the work you are doing and finally a pull request to merge the changes. The PR should be approved by atleast one of the team member after reviewing whether the code is working as expected.  

### ‚ö°Backend 

- [ ] Update the script `backend.py` which accepts requests, loads models and returns predictions for the requests. You can use either FASTAPI or Flask.

### üñ•Ô∏è	Streamlit App

- [ ] Write scripts for your streamlit app which can do the following:
  - [ ] Upload button which accepts json and csv.
  - [ ] Dropdown to select the model to use for prediction. This should also have an option ALL i.e, return predictions from all three models.
  - [ ] Once data is uploaded call the FASTAPI to run the model on data and obtain predictions.
  - [ ] Display the predictions on app UI.
  - [ ] Provide options for exploring your clean dataset - View tables/plots. Here you will import from visualization submodule.
  - [ ] Use `streamlit run Home.py --server.port 5000` to display your app. (You can edit your code and view the changes simultaneously)

### üèóÔ∏è Docker

- [ ] First we will save the requirements by running the following command `pipreqs . --force` in CLI.
- [ ] Now update the Dockerfile script.
- [ ] After updating the Dockerfile script run `docker build .` in terminal.
- [ ] Check your docker UI and check if the image has been created.
- [ ] Now use `docker run` command to run the container. You need to pass additional flags as well. 
- [ ] Click on the URL and test if you are able to view and run the app.
