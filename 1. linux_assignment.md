### ⚙️ Flags & Options to Try

Explore their basic functionality along with various useful flags/options, such as:

- `ls -a` : Show all files, including hidden ones
- `ls -l` : Long listing format
- `rm -rf` : Forcefully remove directories and their contents
- `mkdir -p` : Create nested directories

### 🎓 Assignment

- [ ] Write a shell script `project_template.sh` which does the following: 

  - [ ] Creates a directory structure as given below: 

              ml-project/                # Root directory
              
              ├── app/                   # Module for app
              
              │   ├── pages/             # Add more scripts in this dir to have tabs in your app

    - [ ] Add the following libraries to dev_requirements.txt
      - [ ] black
      - [ ] jupyter-black
      - [ ] pylint
      - [ ] scikit-learn
      - [ ] pandas
      - [ ] numpy
      - [ ] matplotlib
      - [ ] seaborn
  - [ ] In the Home.py script add `# pylint: disable=invalid-name` 


- [ ] In the above `create_environment.sh` script update it to do the following:
  - [ ] Install anaconda (only if it is already not present - use an if clause), create a conda environment named ml-project.
  - [ ] Activate the environment.
  - [ ] Install dev_requirements.txt in the environment.
  - [ ] Install jupyter kernel for your environment to use it in notebooks.
  
- [ ] Explore how to create a python environment (this is different from an anaconda environment).
