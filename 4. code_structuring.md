# Code Structuring 

The aim of this assignment is to **learn how to structure and organize a Machine Learning repository** so that it's scalable, maintainable, and ready for team collaboration or production deployment.

| Skills |
| ------- |
| Package Structure |
| Creating modules & submodules |
| Relative Imports |
| CLI arg parser |
| Object Oriented Programming - classes, decorators, dunder methods |
| PEP-8 Coding standards - formatting and linting python scripts, writing docstrings, function signatures/typehints |
| Version control using git - creating branches, pull requests, code reviewing |

---

This is a group assignment. The work should be divided among the group. Create branches for the work you are doing and finally a pull request to merge the changes. The PR should be approved by atleast one of the team member after reviewing whether the code is working as expected.

## ML Pipeline Development

- [ ] Structure & Code Organization  
    - [ ] Add relevant classes and functions to appropriate modules  
    - [ ] Ensure every folder has an `__init__.py` to enable relative imports  
    - [ ] Use and understand **relative imports** (`from ..module import ...`)

- [ ] Object-Oriented Design  
    - [ ] Use `@dataclass` for all configuration and parameter management classes  
    - [ ] Implement relevant dunder methods (`__str__`, `__call__`, `__len__`, etc.) to improve usability  
    - [ ] Use decorators (e.g., for logging, timing) if needed for repeated patterns  
    - [ ] Keep classes single-responsibility and modular

- [ ] Testing & CLI Integration  
    - [ ] Create a `main.py` that runs the full pipeline via `argparse`  
    - [ ] Add arguments like `--data_path`, `--model`, `--model_path`, `--infer`  
    - [ ] Test training and inference workflows from CLI end-to-end  
    - [ ] Handle errors gracefully with try/except and meaningful error messages  

- [ ] Code Quality & Readability  
    - [ ] Format code using `black`  
    - [ ] Lint using `pylint`; aim for score ≥ 8.5  
    - [ ] Add docstrings for all modules, classes and functions  
    - [ ] Use type hints consistently  
    - [ ] Keep function lengths manageable — refactor if getting too long

- [ ] Configs & Constants  
    - [ ] Define `TrainConfig`, `InferenceConfig`, etc. using `@dataclass`  
    - [ ] Store configurable values like `test_size`, `random_state`, paths in one place  
    - [ ] Allow config overrides via CLI or JSON if needed

- [ ] Saving & Loading  
    - [ ] Ensure trained models are saved properly (e.g., with `joblib` or `pickle` or `dill`)  
    - [ ] Load models in inference script and validate pipeline continuity  
    - [ ] Save metrics, config, and results in structured formats (JSON, CSV)

- [ ] Update `dev_requirements.txt` by running `pip freeze > dev_requirements.txt`
- [ ] Update `setup.py` and understand its purpose
- [ ] Add a demo notebook explaining how to use the package modules
